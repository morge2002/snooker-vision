# Morgan Lewis - Final Year Project

This project aims to accurately detect and track multiple objects in motion even if they are partially obstructed, and to identify when a pot is made in cue sports. Multiple approaches to each component in this project were explored. From this, a final piece of software was produced to detect pots in a cue sports scene.
Balls are detected using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model, they are tracked using a carefully configured BytreTrack algorithm, and multiple pot detection methods are combined to produce an accurate pot detection system.
